`casing.kak` is a Kakoune plugin to easily translate text from one case convention to another. For example, you might have
a file with a bunch of `camelCase` variables that you want to transform to `snake_case`.


Currently the way this plugin solves this problem is by exposing commands to transform variables under the cursor from one
casing convention to another

* snake-to-const
* snake-to-camel
* snake-to-capital
* const-to-snake
* const-to-camel
* const-to-capital
* camel-to-snake
* camel-to-const
* camel-to-capital
* capital-to-snake
* capital-to-const
* capital-to-camel

In the future I would like to provide a new mode to avoid cluttering the command namespace, as well as explore
commands to translate from any casing to the desired case convention, such as `to-camel`, `to-capital` instead of
`\*-to-camel`, `*-to-capital`
